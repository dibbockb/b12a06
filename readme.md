1. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
   both keywords are used to declare variables, const is to create variables that will not change in future. while var and let are used to create varibales that might be changed in future.

2. What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
   map() is used to apply a function's logic and create a new array, forEach() is used to iterate array and do something everytime to it.
   filter() deletes data from a given array and a functions's logic, then returns a new array with only the filtered data.

3. What are arrow functions in ES6?
   arrow functions are shortcut ways to write functions.
   such as 'const arrowFunction = (parameters) => {logic here}

4. How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
   instead of using multiple declaration of variables, we simple put variable names in a const {a, b, c} = 1 ,, all a b c are now = 1. this is used to make code shorter and cleaner.

5. Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
   before es6, people had to manually enter "" , and variable names to properly write an output. this was not clean coding and caused a lot of problem.
   with template literals, we use `` and inside we can use any javascript operation and varibale via ${} . whatever is inside this gets treated like normal code block and gets executed. this makes output easier.
